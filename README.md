## Formalizing Mathematical Proofs With Lean 4
# Written by Aidan Boyle

This repository contains complete formalizations of Zorn's lemma and the well-ordering principle, and an incomplete formalization of the proof of the claim that a prime congruent to one modulo four is a sum of two squares. 
The details of the mathematics behind each proof, along with the lean 4 code of the formalizations, can be found in Zorn.lean, Wellordering.lean, and SumOfSquares.lean respectively.

Moreover, this repository contains a formalization of positive semidefinite Hermitian matrices, along with many of their properties. The details of the implementation can be found in FinalProject.lean. 
Currently, I am working on the formalization of the proof of operator monotonicity of the positive semidefinite squareroot.
